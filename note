visitor pattern
this pattern I would like to call "pick your own pattern".
The pattern illustrate how we can separate a functionality from a class
and still maintain flexibility.
The main element which is the class object will have a method
called accept(v visitor) which will accept the visitor interface
and then pick its own function from the child class that implements
the visitor interface
